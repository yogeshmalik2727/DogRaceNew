Unit Test of project using Instantiation and linking back to the class.

We have an abstract class namely "DogRun" in GreyHound.cs file,
having an abstract method declared as "Run(), this Run() function in emplemented in 
derived class "GreyHound" that let the dogs run from start to end.


1. Instantiation:
> "Guy" class initialises -
	-Name of bettor
	-Total cash in hand
	-Radio buttons

> "Bet" class initialises-
	-Bet Amount
	-Dog Number

> "GreyHound" class initialises -
	-Starting Position
	-Race Track Length
	-Location
	-Picture box
	

2. linking back:
	> "Guy" class links-
		-labels with name of better having cash
		-winning dog amount
		-bet amount with proper description
		
	> "Bet" class links-
		-Payout for bettor
		-Dog Number

	> "GreyHound" class links -
		-Dog run distance, position and race track length
